## What is the xBio:D (trans-biodiversity) Javascript Library?

The xBio:D JS library is used for coupling the xBio:D Database with front end web development. It can:

* provide customizable interactive web elements that are easy to create and use

* create rich, visually engaging graphical widgets that use HTML5 to present the same user experience whether on a computer or a mobile device

* choose which data domains to load while instantiating the library to limit the size of the footprint for speed and utility on mobile devices

* use the same data domains as the OJ_Break API expect for an added “visual” component for xBio:D exclusive visual widgetry
